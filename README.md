- Create or modify files in the repository folder.  
- Check the current status of tracked and untracked files:  
  ```bash
  git status
  ```

#### **Step 3: Stage Files for Commit**  
- Add specific files to be committed:  
  ```bash
  git add <file_name>
  ```
- Or add all changes at once:  
  ```bash
  git add .
  ```
  This stages all modified and new files.  

#### **Step 4: Commit the Changes**  
- Create a commit with a meaningful message:  
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Initial commit: Added project files"
  ```
  The `-m` flag specifies a commit message that describes the changes.  

#### **Step 5: Link to a Remote Repository (If Not Done Already)**  
- If you haven‚Äôt already linked your repository to GitHub, add the remote URL:  
  ```bash
  git remote add origin <repository_url>
  ```
